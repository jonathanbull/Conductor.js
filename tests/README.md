Conductor.js Tests
==================

The Conductor.js Qunit tests are intended to test the core functionality of the
library. The WebSQL and IndexedDB database wrappers, routing and the Kernel are all tested.

To run the tests, simply open 'index.html' in your web browser - it is strongly
recommended to run these tests in a 'Private' browsing mode, otherwise the database
creation tests will not be correctly run.
